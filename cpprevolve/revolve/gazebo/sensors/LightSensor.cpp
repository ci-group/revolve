/// the measurement of the sensor generally lags behind that of the IMU
/// sensor by as much as the actuation time (it might actually be more under
/// bad performance circumstances); which may or may not be an issue. The
/// alternative is to force the sensor to update while we are here in the
/// read method - although I have to check whether this is even possible. In
/// any case that would force the sensor update here on the "driver" thread,
/// which might be detrimental to performance.
