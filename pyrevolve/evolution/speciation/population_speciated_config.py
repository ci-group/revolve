            First parameter is the config of the genome.
            Second is the id of the genome

        :param fitness_function: function that takes in a `RobotManager` as a parameter and produces a fitness for
            the robot. Set to `None` if you want to use `objective_functions` instead.
        :param objective_functions: list of functions that takes in a `RobotManager` as a parameter and produces a
            fitness for the robot. This parameter is to be instead of the `fitness_function` when using an algorithm
            that uses multiple objective optimization, like NSGAII.

        :param mutation_conf: configuration for mutation operator
        :param crossover_operator: operator to be used in crossover.
            First parameter is the list of parents (usually 2).
            Second parameter is the Genotype Conf
            Third parameter is Crossover Conf

            and need to be penalized (the best species is forcefully kept young - age 0)
        :param old_age_fitness_penalty: Fitness multiplier for old species.
            Make sure it is < 1.0 to avoid confusion.
        :param species_max_stagnation: maximum number of iterations without improvement of the species.
        :param offspring_size (optional): size of offspring (for steady state)
