**Revolve** is an open source software framework for robot evolution providing C++ and Python libraries to create,
simulate and manage robots in the Gazebo general-purpose robot simulator. Given a specification, a robot body can be constructed by Revolve from a tree structure, starting with a root node extending to other body parts through its attachment slots. Revolve also ships with some simple generator classes, which can generate arbitrary robot bodies from scratch given a set of constraints.

Revolve was originally developed and is maintained by researchers and engineers working at the Computational Intelligence Group within Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam for the purposes of conducting robot body and brain evolutionary-related research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

## Installation

The current system is supported for Linux and Mac OS X platforms.
If all [pre-requirements](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Gazebo) are satisfied, to install the current release run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ci-group/revolve.git
export SIM_HOME=`pwd` && cd $SIM_HOME/revolve
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

Within the `revolve/` root directory create Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd $SIM_HOME/revolve
virtualenv --python python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To verify the build, run following command to open the Gazebo simulator:
```bash
(.venv) ./revolve.py --simulator-cmd=gazebo
```
If you want to have an overview of all possible Revolve commands, run `./revolve.py --help`.

*See [Installation Instructions for Revolve](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Revolve)
for detailed instructions, and how to build from source.*

#### *Try your first Revolve program*

While `./revolve.py` is running, in another terminal window start the same virtual environment:
```shell
cd ./revolve/
source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) python
```

```python
>>> import asyncio
>>> from pyrevolve.gazebo.manage import WorldManager as World
>>> async def run():
...     world = await World.create()
...     await world.pause(True)
...     print("Hello Revolve! I paused Gazebo.")
... 
>>> loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
>>> loop.run_until_complete(run())
Hello Revolve! I paused Gazebo.
```
