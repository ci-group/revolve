# HOW TO USE CELERY
#### Celery is a task distribution manager. We can start it from this folder, however most
#### of the times it would be better to start it from the revolve folder.

In Revolve/

We can start revolve using celery when you use the next line.

*./revolve.py --manager pycelery/manager.py --n-cores 8 --world worlds/celeryplane.world*

This will start the manager, which uses the class *CeleryController* to control and start celery. The manager can shutdown, reset, evaluate robots through this CeleryController and it is used as a simulator_queue class, such that it can be used in a population class.

The *celeryplane.world* loads the worldcontroller for celery. If you do not use this, the C++ part is not able to receive and send messages to celery and therefore the experiment will not work. So make sure to add that in. (TODO make celeryplane.world default in celerycontroller)

## IF IN ANY CASE THE EXPERIMENT FAILS
If the experiment fails, celery, gzservers and the amqp queue can still be running in the background. When you start celery again this will give problems. Therefore, whenever your prematurely end an experiment, remember to quit celery, gzservers and empty the celery queue with the following commands:

`pkill -9 -f 'celery worker' && pkill -9 -f 'gzserver'`  

`celery amqp && queue.delete cpp && queue.delete robots (OR $ celery -A proj purge)`

## EXAMPLE
Use the [manager.py](manager.py) file in the pycelery folder as an example to make your own experiment.

## CHANGED FILES
[population.py](../pyrevolve/evolution/population.py)  
Added some code such that the population class can still be used. The old revolve maintains useable.
 
[robotmanager.py](../pyrevolve/tol/manage/robotmanager.py)  
The robotmanager is changed so it can now convert JSON data from a celery message to a robotmanager. This way many already created modules can still be used.

## PROBLEMS

**-1.** Celery is currently using RabbitMQ and RPC (remote procedure call) to handle messages. RPC is dependent on the
network you are connected to. If the network disconnects the experiment stops. The current
solution is rebooting the network and restarting the experiment.

**-2.** If a robot takes a lot of time, the get request will back off for max 1 second before trying again. However,
this 1 second between get request holds on to long. You will get moments were there is exactly 1 second between
robot results. I am not sure how to get rid of this delay after the that initial robot is evaluated (then the timer should
go back to like 0.01 or something).

**-3.** If a gazebo instance is running, the robot simulation time is building up. This is normal since robots
are getting more complex over time, however I believe it should decrease and at some point reach a threshold.
It is not memory leaking because the memory usage is not increasing, however the computation time is. A solution is
restarting the simulator per X generations, however I think it should be possible without restarting.

**-4.** If in any case the experiment is disrupted, and stopped, celery messages can still be in the system. Restarting without removing
these messages will give errors. So before restarting the experiment; celery, gazebo and the messages need to be deleted.
This can be done by the following two commands:

`pkill -9 -f 'celery worker' && pkill -9 -f 'gzserver'`

`celery amqp && queue.delete cpp && queue.delete robots (OR $ celery -A proj purge)`
